       "\" \\nMarch 16, 2012 \\nThe Honorable Richard Cordray \\nDirector \\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau 1500 Pennsylvania Ave. NW (Attn: 1801 L St.) Washington DC 20220 \\n \\nDear Director Cordray: \\nThe National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) believes that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has a critical opportunity to create a safe and sound mortgage marketplace through its promulgation of a rule implementing the qualified mortgage (QM) provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. We understand that the Center for Responsible Lending, the Consumer Federation of America, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and the Clearing House Association have submitted a comment letter (joint comment) that proposes a standard for Qualified Mortgages (QM). The joint comment letter represents important advances in creating a consensus for a solid QM rule, but it still would leave consumers without adequate protections against unscrupulous lending. \\nNCRC is an association of more than 600 community-based organizations that promote access to basic banking services including credit and savings, to create and sustain affordable housing, job development and vibrant communities for America's working families.  As such, NCRC and our members have witnessed first-hand the rampant abuses in the lending marketplace during the last several years.  A lack of strong consumer protection and regulation enabled reckless and ill-advised lending practices resulting in record levels of foreclosure and profound economic and social damage to American families and communities.  \\nNeed for a Participatory and Transparent Rulemaking Process \\nThe QM rule represents a rare opportunity to promulgate a standard-setting rule that would promote access to responsible credit. This rule could very well influence the contours of the mortgage market for decades to come. It is thus critical that the CFPB strikes the correct balance when considering access to credit, consumer protections, and safety and soundness. When the Federal Reserve issued its proposed QM rule last summer, it was our assumption that the CFPB would consider the Federal ReserveÕs \\nproposed rule but re-issue its own proposed rule and ask for another round of public comments. However, we now understand that the CFPB may make changes to the Federal Reserve rule and then issue a final rule without public comment. \\nIssuing a final rule without another round of public comment would be a profound mistake, especially for a rule that could impact access to and soundness of credit for generations. NCRC has 600 member organizations that regularly comment on vital regulations impacting access to credit for the residents of minority and working class neighborhoods that our members serve through housing counseling, affordable housing, and other services. In addition, members of the public themselves that have been victimized by unscrupulous lending have a right to comment on proposed regulation that will impact them and their childrenÕs prospects for homeownership.  \\nAt this point, the CFPB will receive the joint comment and reaction to the joint comment from additional industry and community-based organizations. If this is the only communication the CFPB receives before issuing a final rule, the CFPB will be unable to consider the full range of perspectives when deciding on its final rule. The comments reacting to a private sector proposal (that is, the joint comment) will not comprehensively address all the complex legal and policy issues. Only if the CFPB issues its own proposal for QM and asks for comments, can the CFPB receive the complete perspective, backed with experiences and facts, from comment letters.  \\nPrinciples for a QM Rule \\nNCRC believes that when developing a QM rule, the CFPB must satisfy the principles of equitable access to safe and sound credit. The CFPB can preserve access to credit by creating a QM rule that allows the clear majority of safe and sound loans to qualify as QM. Before unscrupulous subprime and non-traditional lending swarmed the marketplace in the early to mid-2000s, subprime and non-traditional lending constituted the minority of lending with a market share of 10 to 20 percent. The unregulated marketplace facilitated this type of lending which was niche lending to become the dominant form lending during the mid to late 2000s.  \\nA QM rule can restore the role of non-traditional and high-cost lending to niche lending that responds to certain market segments such as some affluent customers who do not wish to document their income. At the same time, a sensible QM rule can insure that the majority of lending has standard and well understood features and is prudently underwritten. If the CFPB closely follows statutory intent in defining QM, then the great majority of subprime and non-traditional lending will be non-QM loans while well underwritten prime loans will be QM loans. Lending institutions will have incentives to \\nfocus on QM lending, meaning that the non-QM subprime and non-traditional lending will be a relatively small segment of the market unlike the case in the mid to late 2000s. \\nThe CFPB must be careful not to create an unduly restrictive QM definition. A narrow QM definition that allows only a minority of prime loans to qualify as QM will create a dual lending marketplace in which the affluent will receive the lowest cost loans and minorities and working class consumers will receive either much fewer loans or higher cost loans. Such an outcome would contradict the responsibilities of the CFPB to enforce the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and other fair lending laws.  \\nWhile promoting access, a QM rule must also implement rigorous safeguards so reckless lending will no longer imperil the health of domestic and international economies. It is imperative that the CFPB promulgate features of QM that follow statutory intent and that result in loans with low default rates. In addition, consumers must be afforded opportunities to defend themselves and their equity in court against attempts by some lenders to qualify their abusive loans as QM loans.  \\nJoint Comment Letter Ð Too Few Consumer Protections \\nThe joint comment letter offers some important advances for possible consensus among industry and consumer organizations but proposes too few consumer protections in its eagerness to create high volumes of loans that qualify as QM.  \\nAdjustable Rate Mortgages Ð Too High a Tolerance in QM Definition \\nThe joint comment letter is to be commended for offering a protection for adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) that is beyond the protection offered in the Dodd-Frank law. Specifically, the joint comment letter asserts that ARMs regardless of QM status must be underwritten at the maximum possible rate in the first six years. The Dodd-Frank law requires underwriting at the maximum possible rate during the first five years for only QM loans. NCRC appreciates the joint comment letterÕs responsiveness to the abuses in ARM lending by lengthening the time period of underwriting and applying a uniform standard to QM and non-QM loans. Yet, a six year time period would not protect against ARM loans with increasing interest rates in year seven and beyond. Thus, the other QM protections against abuse must be stronger than those in the joint comment letter.  \\nMoreover, the joint comment letter proposes as part of the QM definition allowing ARM loans to increase by 200 basis points in one year and 500 basis points over the life of the loan. If these provisions, which are not part of the Dodd-Frank law, are added to the very definition of QM loans, the QM definition will be sanctioning ARM lending with hefty interest rate increases. This is not necessary for the industryÕs desire to make high \\nvolumes of QM loans and would undermine the consumer protections the Dodd-Frank QM provision seeks. \\nJoint Comment ÒWaterfallÓ is Too Steep with Too Many Rocks and Other Hazards \\nThe joint comment letterÕs ÒwaterfallÓ or series of criteria beyond the QM definition would allow too many risky loans to qualify as QM. The joint comment letter would allow a loan with a total debt-to-income ratio (TDTI) above 43 percent to qualify as QM if the monthly housing payment to income ratio was above 31 percent and if the borrower successfully made housing payments over an unspecified number of months and the new housing payment was no more than 5 percent of the previous housing payments. The minimum time period NCRC would propose for successful housing payments would be one year and this provision would have to be accompanied with a clause that the borrower received counseling from a HUD certified counseling agency regarding the affordability of the mortgage. We understand that the parties to the joint comment considered counseling but could not agree on specifics.  \\nAnother worrisome aspect of the waterfall is that it would allow 18 months of liquid reserves to meet mortgage payments in the case of high TDTI loans. Although a limit of 60 percent of the reserves could come from accounts like retirement savings that have a penalty for withdrawal, NCRC believes that a reserve criteria in the waterfall would dangerously expose the savings of older Americans.  \\nNCRCÕs Proposed Waterfall \\nThe joint comment letterÕs waterfall underwent a series of changes over the last few days of negotiations between industry and community groups that made the waterfall too complicated and still allowed the possibility of too many risky loans qualifying as QM. Since the joint comment waterfall adopts an outer bound of 50 percent TDTI, NCRC proposes the following streamlined waterfall that would promote a higher of volume of safe and sound loans qualifying as QM in a ÒscalableÓ manner with clear bright lines. \\nIf a loanÕs TDTI is more than 43 percent and otherwise meets the basic QM definition established by the CFPB, the following tests could be applied: \\n. TDTI: Is the loanÕs TDTI no more than 50 percent? (If yes, the loan is a QM loan. If no, then continue). \\n\\n. Housing payment and counseling: Has the borrower had stable income for the past year and made timely mortgage payments or rental payments and debt payments over the last year, and would his or her new monthly housing obligations be no more than 5 percent higher than current obligations? Timely \\n\\n\\npayments would be defined as no more than one 30 day late in the last year. In addition to meeting these conditions, a borrower would be required to document that he received counseling regarding the affordability and sustainability of the new mortgage payment from a HUD-certified counselor. (If yes to these conditions, the loan is QM. If no, then continue). \\n\\n. Residual income: Is the borrowerÕs net residual income above the minimum threshold established by the CFPB or another government agency such as VeteranÕs Affairs (If yes, the loan is QM. If no, and the loan does not meet one of the other criteria in the waterfall, the loan is not a QM loan) \\n\\n\\nNCRC believes that our proposed waterfall is an improvement over the joint comment letter in terms of simplicity and also more effectively screens out unsafe loans. However, we would urge the CFPB to conduct more research regarding default rates associated with TDTI ratios of up to 50 percent. While this has been a commonly discussed threshold for anti-predatory legislation and regulation over the years, it has not been subjected to rigorous data analysis. Data analysis may suggest that the 43 percent and 50 percent ratios in NCRCÕs waterfall should be replaced with 41 percent and 45 percent ratios or some other ratios. Moreover, the Urban Institute has conducted important research concluding that loans with housing counseling reduces defaults but it would be important, for the CFPB to investigate default rates for counseling in the context of a borrower receiving a loan with a modestly higher monthly payment. The additional CFPB research should be presented in a preamble to a proposed rule. The development of waterfalls without attempting rigorous research risks establishing standards that would be long-term but would not effectively protect consumers.  \\nRebuttable Presumption \\nThe Dodd-Frank law creates an opportunity for a consumer to contest a QM loan if the borrower believes that the loan was issued without considerations of ability-to-repay. The statute sought to strike a compromise between promoting the issuance of safe and sound QM loans by offering limited liability to the industry while still allowing borrowers to defend themselves from particularly egregious loans.  \\nNCRC urges the CFPB to establish a rule with clear rebuttable presumption standards. A critical component of rebuttable presumption would be the ability of the borrower and her attorney to employ residual income analysis to show that the lender made an unaffordable loan. The joint comment letter acknowledges residual income analysis by allowing a mention of residual income in  Federal Reserve proposed commentary. However, commentary usually confers vague and unclear legal standards and does not have the same force as explicitly mentioning residual income analysis as a defense in the QM \\nregulation. Without an explicit right for the borrower to use residual income analysis, judges are unlikely to allow it as a defense against abusive loans.  \\nThe joint comment raises the bar preventing an effective borrower defense even further by requiring a borrower to provide comprehensive information before a loan closing regarding all debts. The joint comment letter specifies that the parties to the comment disagree that the information has to be provided by the borrower in writing, but either a written or oral requirement would be too onerous. In the heat of the moment when trying to qualify for a loan, a borrower will not be in a mindset to provide comprehensive information about all debts. Moreover, the borrower will usually provide only the information that a broker or loan officer will require. In addition, the joint comment allows the lender to alter or omit the information a borrower provides if the lender has a ÒreasonableÓ basis for doing so. Placing the final burden on the borrower for providing information and potentially allowing a lender to manipulate the information dangerously reduces the ability of the borrower to defend himself or herself in court. \\nIn sum, the lack of an explicit residual income defense and the information burden are likely to combine to make the rebuttable presumption standard in the joint comment letter an effective Òsafe harborÓ making it impossible for borrowers to defend themselves in court. This outcome contradicts the intent of Dodd-Frank to create safe and sound lending by allowing legal redress even in the case of QMs if some QMs turn out to be abusive.  \\nOther Concerns \\nThe QM rulemaking presents a series of other complex issues that need further consideration and research before the issuance of a final rule. For example, the three percent fee cap, particularly in the cases of smaller loans predominantly used by lower income borrowers, needs more research. Is three percent too low in the case of smaller loans or would it effectively prevent fee gouging while still allowing safe and sound loans to qualify for QM. Public review of comprehensive data analysis of the components of points and fees is desperately needed in this rulemaking. In addition, the joint comment letter errs on allowing a cushion or tolerance for TDTI and for qualifying steamlined refinances to qualify as QM. A discussion of these complex issues in a standard rulemaking process is needed. \\nConclusion  \\nNCRC urges the CFPB to issue a proposed QM rule subject to public comment before finalizing QM regulations. The stakes are too high regarding access to affordable and sustainable mortgages. The joint comment letter provides possibilities for consensus on some important concepts, but would not sufficiently protect borrowers from abusive \\nloans. There are too many unresolved issues and needs for additional research to finalize a rule without a public comment period. A rule that could profoundly impact the mortgage market for decades to come requires more transparency and public participation in its formation.  \\nThank you for consideration of our comments. If you have any questions, please contact me or Josh Silver, Vice President of Research and Policy, on 202-628-8866.  \\nSincerely, \\n \\n\\nJohn Taylor \\nPresident and CEO \\n \\n\\n\""
